## Overview
In this competition, you had to create an AI agent to play the Hungry Geese game, a variant of the classic Snake game. The core heart of the solution is based on an open source reinforcement learning framework called HandyRL. HandyRL mainly provides a policy gradient algorithm with off-policy correction. The agent was trained by self-play. To improve the base modelâ€™s predictions, Monte Carlo Tree Search was applied - as done in AlphaGo.
